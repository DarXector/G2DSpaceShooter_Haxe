G2DSpaceShooter_Haxe
====================

A mini space shooter game.
Code based on an old Genome2D AS3 tutorial by Dylan Meville.
http://dylanmeville.com/G2D/tutorials/G2DSpaceShooter/G2DSpaceShooterTutorial.pdf

Rewritten in Haxe and updated to work with the latest version of Genome2D.
Updated to comply with my general way of orginizing the code.
I moved further from the tutorial with game features and will not stop here.

The code is not yet commented it is on my TODO list.
